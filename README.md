ODI Devon supporting Libraries Unlimited with their social value research project
## Datasets
We've taken sample data from the libraries systems about borrowers (anonymised) and transactions to begin with. We'll be building a small collection of datasets initially to support the Discovery Day on 17th March, and after that we want to look at what datasets you'd like to see. To start with we have some information about the top ten titles issued in January 2017 across fiction books, CDs and DVDs; transactions for January 2017; and the breakdown of registered borrowers by Devon Town area across age and IMD 2015 decile.
